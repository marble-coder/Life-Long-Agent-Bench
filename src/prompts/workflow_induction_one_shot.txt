Summary Workflows:

# Workflow 1: Filter records by single condition
1. SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <column_name> = '<value>'
2. Verify the result contains expected records

# Workflow 2: Filter records by comparison condition
1. SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <column_name> > <value>
2. Check the filtered results match the criteria

# Workflow 3: Aggregate data with GROUP BY and COUNT
1. SELECT <group_column>, COUNT(*) FROM <table_name> GROUP BY <group_column>
2. Analyze the counts for each group

# Workflow 4: Join tables and aggregate
1. SELECT <column>, SUM(<value_column>) FROM <table1> JOIN <table2> ON <table1>.<key> = <table2>.<key> GROUP BY <column>
2. Review the aggregated results from joined tables

# Workflow 5: Filter aggregated results with HAVING
1. SELECT <column>, COUNT(*) FROM <table_name> GROUP BY <column> HAVING COUNT(*) > <threshold>
2. Examine groups that meet the threshold condition
